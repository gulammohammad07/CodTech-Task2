Overview of a Student Grading System in Java

I recently developed a student grading system in Java, which calculates and assigns grades based on students' scores. This project was a great way to apply Java concepts in a practical scenario, and I'd like to share a quick overview of how the system works.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:
User Input Handling:

The system prompts the user (typically a teacher or administrator) to input student details, including their name and scores for various subjects.
It can handle multiple students and subjects.
Score Calculation:

The system calculates the total and average score for each student.
Based on the average score, the system assigns a grade (e.g., A, B, C, D, F) according to predefined grading criteria.
Grade Assignment:

The grading system typically follows a standard like:
A for 60+
B for >50 && <60
C for >40 && <50
D for 35 && <40
F for <35
The grade is then displayed along with the student's name and scores.
